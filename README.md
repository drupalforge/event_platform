This repository creates a site using the Drupal default
[drupal/recommended-project](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/starting-a-site-using-drupal-composer-project-templates#s-drupalrecommended-project).

In addition, it pulls in Event Platform Starter and performs the installation
steps outlined in its README file. The result is a robust site that has Drupal
Event Platform, Event Horizon, and elements of Drupal CMS all set up and ready
to use.
